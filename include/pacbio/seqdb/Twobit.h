/// \brief Converts a sequence to a 2-bit packed array.
///
/// \note  Any contiguous sequence of non-ACTG bases is called a "range".
///        If a non-ACTG base is found, a new range is constructed.
///        This is a lossy compression, because any non-ACTGN base will be
///        considered as an N.
///
///        To understand the purpose of a Range better, imagine an input sequence
///        "ACTGNNNTTT". If we were to split this sequence on N-bases,
///        we would get two subsequences: "ACTG" and "TTT".
///        The "ACTG" subsequence begins at position 0 and ends at position 4, so
///        it's range is (0, 4).
///        The "TTT" subsequence begins at position 7 and ends at position 10, so
///        it's range is (7, 10).
///        Since N-bases cannot be encoded in 2 bits, we remove them
///        from the final compressed sequence. All other bases are just
///        "condensed" into: "ACTGTTT" during compression, and we can decode
///        where the N-bases need to go through the vector of Ranges.
